Finance_Loan Data Analysis

Predicting whether or not a loan will be default using the historical data.
#

Problem Statement:  

For companies like Lending Club correctly predicting whether or not a loan will be a default is very important. In this project, using the historical data from 2007 to 2015, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans. As you will see later this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that makes this problem more challenging.
